If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with Cascade. £5/1/2009 : When the Cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not your cast the last card exiled. £5/1/2009 : If a spell with Cascade is countered, the Cascade ability will still resolve normally. £5/1/2009 : You exile †the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them. £5/1/2009 : If you exile a split card with Cascade, check if at least one half of that split card has a converted mana cost that's less than the converted mana cost of the spell with cascade. If so, you can cast either half of that split card. £5/1/2009 : If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell. £5/1/2009 : After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.@@Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom in a random order.)£Creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn.

You can cast it only at the normal time you could cast an artifact spell. It also doesn't change the spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. The only difference is the cost you actually pay. £5/1/2009 : Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast this card will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay. £5/1/2009 : To satisfy the alternative cost, you may return any basic land you control to its owner's hand, regardless of that land's subtype or whether it's tapped. £5/1/2009 : As you cast a spell, you get a chance to activate mana abilities before you pay that spell's costs. Therefore, you may tap a basic land for mana, then both spend that mana and return that land to your hand to pay this card's alternative cost. (Of course, you can return a different basic land instead.)@@You may pay {1} and return a basic land you control to its owner's hand rather than pay Wildfield Borderpost's mana cost.£Wildfield Borderpost enters the battlefield tapped.£{T}: Add {G} or {W} to your mana pool.
